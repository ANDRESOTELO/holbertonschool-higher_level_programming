# Python - More Classes and Objects
## Classes
Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.

## Objects
An Object is an instance of a Class. A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values. Its not an idea anymore, its an actual dog, like a dog of breed pug whos seven years old. You can have many dogs to create many different instances, but without the class as a guide, you would be lost, not knowing what information is required.
